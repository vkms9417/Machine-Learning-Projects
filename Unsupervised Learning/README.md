**Unsupervised Learning Project:**

This project uses most popular unsupervised algorithm i.e. K means to classify the 
cars based on given features. This project has 2 Parts:

**Part 1**- Built an AIML model to classify cars based on its function, features, weight 
etc.

**Part 2**- Implement PCA technique to reduce overfitting problem, and Hyper tunning 
technique to improve the accuracy of model.
Skills and Tools: KMeans, ,EDA, SVM, PCA, Classification, Hyper tunning, Python
